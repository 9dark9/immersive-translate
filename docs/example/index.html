        The Chinese who tell their story in these pages are not the major
        political leaders whose names have come to define our sense of modem
        China. Though leaders of the Nationalist Guomindang Party such as Sun
        Yatsen and Chiang Kaishek, and Communist leaders like Mao Zedong and
        Zhou Enlai, are discussed to some extent, I have preferred to
        concentrate on certain other individuals whose lives were not so
        obviously central to the course of the revolution but who nevertheless
        described their hopes and their sorrows with particular sensitivity, and
        whose personal experiences help to define the nature of the times
        through which they lived. The main narrative line is carried by three
        people. The first is the scholar Kang Youwei, trained in the canons of
        traditional Confucianism, who became a spokesman for radical reform as
        the Qing dynasty drew to its close in the late nineteenth century, and
        after political failures and exile sought in utopian speculation a
        solace for his current sorrows. The second is Lu Xun, who studied
        medicine in Japan as a young man and then, after switching his
        allegiance to the realm of literature, came to be the most articulate
        spokesman for the thwarted longings of his students and his countrymen
        during the 1920s. The third is Ding Ling, educated as a girl into the
        emancipated world of the “new” China after the Qing dynasty fell, who
        became both a writer and a political activist and had to learn the hard
        way how great were the dissonances between her own creative talents and
        the criteria for artistic life that were imposed, seriatim, by both the
        Guomindang Nationalists and the Communists.
